This project is named SAVVY and it provides young New Zealand voters with a way to make an informed voting choice. In order to do this, it provides easy to understand information on NZ government and parliment, how voting works, a policy comparison, and a value-based quiz.

There is a serious lack of political education in New Zealand schools, and it is hard to find coalated and indepth resources on parties and their policies as it comes up to election time. As a young voter, I wished there was an easy way to see what each party was campaigning on, all in one place. Now there is!

There are two user flows. One is to go through the quiz, the other is to get a policy comparison. These are available in the hi-fi but not in the code.

### Known issues!
Only the homepage is coded.
